Some people will find it very easy to run Virtual Universe.  It is easy for the most part.
While running Virtual Universe and configuring it is simple for some the network and port forwarding
is harder.  This tutorial will help you learn how to make sure your network is forwarding the proper
ports both in your firewall and your gateway (router/ modem).  The methods in this tutorial have been
tested and fully work.  If you follow this guide you should be up and going in no time at all.
  To setup Virtual Universe please see the Setting up Universe.txt 
  If you are using development code and need to compile first please follow the instructions 
in Compiling.txt for your system before continuing on with configuring Virtual Universe.

## Opening Ports in WIndows FIrewall
##
  In order to get your viewer and your consoles communicating you need to open ports in your 
Windows firewall first.  For most Windows users this will be pretty quick and simple.
  Follow these steps for your Windows firewall:
      1. Click Start -> Control Panel.
      2. Click on Windows Firewall.
      3. In the Windows Firewall click on Advanced Settings.
      4. In Advanced settings you will see Inbound Ports and Outbound Ports.
      5. First click on Inbound Ports.
      6. Now click on New Rule
      7. A wizard will open up. Select Ports
      8. Select TCP and enter 8002-8013 and click next.
      9. Next you will be given the option to allow connection.  Make sure this is checked.
      10. Next you will get an option to set this rule for Domain, Public, and Private. Check all 3.
      11. Last you will be asked to name the rule.  It is easiest to use Incoming Ports 8002-8013TCP.
      12. Also in the description it is helpful to add what the ports are for. such as grid ports.
      13. Click Finish.
   Now repeat these steps for the region ports beginning at port 9000TCP.  Also repeat this step for
the Inbound UDP ports.
   To set the Outbound TCP and UDP ports its the same process as above.  Once this is done your firewall
is set for Windows Firewall.  On to the Gateway stuff.......
   NOTE for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 users.  You have to put the ports in as follows:
   8002, 8003, 8004, 8005, 8006, 8007, 8008, 8009, 8010, 8011, 8012, 8013
   This will make sure the firewall accepts the rule in Windows 2008 Server and Windows 2008 Server R2.

## Port forwarding in your Network Gateway (modem/ router)
##
  For many people today the new internet modems given by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) also will act 
  as a Network Gateway and firewall to block ports.  So you must also ensure the ports used for Virtual Universe are
  unblocked here as well.  Because there are so many different routers and modems out there, I will encourage
  you to consult your router/ modem user manual on how to forward the ports.  Remember even if your doing a 
  local grid only if you have followed the instructions in Opening ports in Windows Firewall and you still
  cannot connect,, this most likely will be the culprit.  To bind the ports to your machine's interrnal IP address
  in your local network it is best to use a static IP.  Please see setting up static IP below to learn how to
  accomplish this.
	  
##
## Changing your Internal IP to Static
##
  When many people here the term Static IP they think you have to purchase this from your ISP.  
  For your external IP address to be static this is true.  However you can get a FQDN for this at
  DynDNS.com or ddns.net.  They will give you one FQDN subdomain such as you.dyndns.org or you.ddns.net for free.
  After you have obtained a FQDN you can usually insert this in your Modem/ Gateway depending on your router.
  Again consult your modem/ router manuel for the instructions on how to accomplish this. 
	  
  To establish and give your machine a static ip address on your local network on Windows is very simple.
  To do this follow these steps.
      1. Go to http://www.portforward.com and click Static IP on the page.
      2. You will be asked if you want to download and or run application.  Select Download (run in Explorer).
      3. Install the application.  You will be asked for a registration key.  No need to panic here, Just select
      trial and you will be ok and click next.
      4. After installed right click the PF icon on your desk top and select Run as Administrator (for Windows Vista,
      Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 2008 Server, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012.
      NOTE: If your server is being hosted in a Datacenter you do not need an internal static IP as this is already done.
      5. It will show the current IPs and available Ips on your local network.  Click Make Static.
      6. You will be asked if you want to apply the change.  Click APply Change.
      7. Thats it your done.  When it has configured the static IP on your NIC card you will be given your new internal IP.
      In most cases it will be the first Static IP on the network.  If so it will either be: 
      192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 depending on the gateway (router/ modem).

  That is it.  Now if you have followed these instructions and the instructions for port forwarding in your gateway's user
  manual, your Virtual Universe should not have any trouble at all connecting to your viewer or Universe.exe having trouble
  connecting to Universe.Server.exe.

## FAQ
##
  Q: I don't have a Network Gateway and my Modem does not do port forwarding, what do I do?
  A: If this is the case then if you follow the steps for giving your tower a static IP and opening the ports
     in Windows Firewall you should not have any issues.

  Q: I followed these instructions and the instructions in my modem's user manual but it still doesnt connect, Why?
  A: First double check you didn't mistype something or get the wrong setting.  If this does not work you can ask
     for assistance.  I am happy to help.  Just email your issue to secondgalaxy2013@gmail.com or you can often
