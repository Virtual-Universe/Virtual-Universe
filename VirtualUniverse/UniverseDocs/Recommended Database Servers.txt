## Recomended Database Servers to use with Virtual-Universe
##

##
## Introduction
##

After careful testing by the Second Galaxy Development Team and input from our collaborating partners,
 we are proud to provide our recommendations relating to the best database servers to use for your Virtual Universe.  
Our testing involves very high level stress tests, speed tests, general use tests, and other tests that are common
 in the software development industry.  We never make a recommendation that we know will create issues to the end user.
  
##
## Use in Standalone mode
##

The best server to use if you are not running a full grid and are just in standalone mode and using it for creating 
content or just for fun then the built in SQLite is just fine and will run very smoothly and fast.

##
## Grid Mode
##

For those who are running a full grid or are using Virtual Universe as part of a bigger project that requires scalability
 and speed we recommend you use one of the following:

* MariaDB - MariaDB is the same as MySQL but is much better both on Windows and Linux.  We have also found it to be less cumbersome
 as well as less burden for the operating system and processor.  If you run your DB on Linux you can even enable TokuDB which
 will compress the database tables making it even faster.

* MongoDB - Unfortunately we do not currently support MongoDB but we are in the process of working on its implementation.
  MongoDB is fast and stable for a database system both on Windows, and Nix systems.  More to Come on MongoDB.

* PostGre DB - We do not recommend the usage of PostGre DB and do not currently support it.

* SQLite - It is not advisable to use the SQLite system to run a grid.  However it can be done but you do so at your own risk.

##
## User Asset Storage
##

Virtual Universe comes with a built in FileBasedStorage system.  Using this instead of storing the assets in your database tables
 will also speed up your grid not to mention make your database smaller.  The FileBasedStorage is easy to configure and enable in the
 configuration files.
